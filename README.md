# vinclorealestate.com

Static site for **Vinclo Real Estate** — a Texas-based short-term rental arbitrage business. Deployed on Vercel with Supabase for auth and data persistence.

## Stack

- Static HTML/CSS/JS — no frontend framework
- Supabase (auth + database)
- Vercel (hosting)

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
2. Run `node scripts/build.js` to generate `js/auth.js`
3. Open `index.html` locally or deploy to Vercel

The build script injects Supabase credentials into `js/auth.js` at build time. The generated file is gitignored.

## Calculator

`admin.html` includes a **Property Financial Calculator** — an internal tool for evaluating rental arbitrage opportunities in Abilene, TX. Access requires authentication.

### Features

- **Scenario analysis** — best/base/worst case (±15pp occupancy, ±15% ADR)
- **Investment summary** — total initial investment, payback period, 12- and 24-month ROI
- **Automated risk flags** — break-even occupancy, worst-case cash flow, revenue multiple, rent threshold, stay length
- **HOA hard block** — disqualifies properties with HOA; save/export disabled while active
